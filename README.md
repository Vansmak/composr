## Multi-Host Setup

### Enabling Docker Remote API

To connect to remote Docker hosts, you need to enable the Docker Remote API on each target host.

#### Method 1: Docker Daemon Configuration
```bash
# Edit /etc/docker/daemon.json on the target host
{
  "hosts": ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock", "tcp://0.0.0.0:2375"]
}

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### Method 2: Environment Variable Configuration
Add to your Composr docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  composr:
    environment:
      - DOCKER_HOSTS=local=unix:///var/run/docker.sock,prod=tcp://192.168.1.100:2375,staging=tcp://192.168.1.101:2375
```

#### Method 3: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to the **Hosts** tab in Composr
2. Click **Add New Docker Host**
3. Enter the host details:
   - **Display Name**: e.g., "Production Server"
   - **Docker URL**: e.g., "tcp://192.168.1.100:2375"
   - **Description**: Optional description
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify
5. Click **Add Host** to save

### Security Considerations
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only enable the Docker Remote API on trusted networks. For production environments, consider using TLS certificates for secure connections.

## Project Creation Wizard

The Project Creation feature supports multi-host deployment:

### How to Use
1. Go to **Config** tab ‚Üí **Create** subtab
2. **Step 1**: Enter project name, choose location, and customize the compose template
3. **Step 2**: Review your project and choose deployment target:
   - **Local Docker**: Deploy to the local Composr host
   - **Remote Host**: Select any connected Docker host for deployment
   - **Create Only**: Just create the project files without deployment

### Multi-Host Features
- **Host Selection**: Choose which Docker host to deploy your new project to
- **Cross-Host Deployment**: Deploy from Composr to any connected Docker host
- **Host-Specific Validation**: Ensures target host is available before deployment
- **Deployment Feedback**: Detailed success/failure information for multi-host deployments

## Container Operations Across Hosts

### Supported Operations
- **Start/Stop/Restart**: Control containers on any connected host
- **Remove**: Delete containers from remote hosts
- **Logs**: View real-time logs from containers on any host
- **Terminal**: Execute commands in containers regardless of host location
- **Inspect**: View detailed container information across hosts
- **Batch Operations**: Perform actions on multiple containers across different hosts

### Host Identification
- **Host Badges**: Every container shows which host it belongs to
- **Host Filtering**: Filter view to show containers from specific hosts only
- **Host Grouping**: Group containers by host for better organization
- **Cross-Host Search**: Search for containers across all connected hosts

## Security Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This application has full control over Docker containers on all connected hosts. It should only be deployed in trusted environments and should not be exposed to the public internet without proper authentication.

**Multi-Host Security**: When connecting to remote Docker hosts, ensure the Docker Remote API is only accessible on trusted networks. Consider using VPN or SSH tunnels for added security.

**Backup Security**: Backup files contain your complete Docker configuration from all hosts including environment variables. Store backup files securely and avoid sharing them unless necessary.
